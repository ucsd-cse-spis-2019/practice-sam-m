# I'm from Murrieta (about an hour north of SD). 
# I'm hoping to learn the logic and understanding of computer science necessary to succeed in CSE 11 so I can get ahead by a quarter for my Comp Sci major. 
# An activity I'd like to participate in during SPIS is tennis. I don't have much other plans haha
